# Daily Standup
- Yesterday, I worked on finding a map of the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO). This map will be used for the map feature of the cycle. Today, I will do research on the integration of the map and what specific component(s) are needed to allow the user to zoom in and out of the map. Currently there is an impediment where there are multiple maps for each of the different floors of the hospital. We will need to reach out to the stakeholders to determine next steps.
