# Shape up (Chapter 2-5) Summary
## Chapter 2 Summary
- Work shaping is about striking a balance between being too detailed and too vague. Directly using wireframes or mockups can limit the designers creativity and causes estimation mistakes. Details can lead to unexpected complexities. Vague project descriptions like "build a calendar view" can confuse teams, cleared insutrctions are needed so decisions can be made and boundaries can be set.

- Shaped work isn't detailed but gives enough information for teams to start. While rough, shaped work is meticulously considered, with main components all connected. Shaped work defines what to do and what not to do. It guides teams to work within set boundaries. Shaping requires a mix of design, technical, and strategic thinking. Shaping and building are distinct, when one team is building, shapers prepare future projects.

- The steps to shaping are: Setting time and problem boundaries, sketching a broad solution, identifying and tackling risks, preparing a pitch for the potential project.

## Chapter 3 Summary
- In the process of shaping, the initial step is to establish boundaries of what needs to be done for the successful completion of a project. This starts with the conception of a raw idea, which is the initial ask by stakeholders regarding what product or feature they would like to see implemented. Afterwards, the ‘appetite’ is set, which is determining if different ideas and features can be actioned upon within the time that is available. The appetite stage is very important because skipping this step or prematurely starting the project may either lead to wasted resources or long discussions that result in no progress. In essence, appetite is the amount of time that the team will allocate, with there being the concept of a small batch and big batch. A small batch is when it is a smaller team with a project that can be completed within 2 weeks and a big batch is when the scope is a bit bigger and can be completed in 6 weeks.
- If a project has a scope that is larger than what can be done in 6 weeks, then it needs to be narrowed down and the team must reestablish what is truly the core aspect of the project. This is what is know in shaping as fixed time and variable scope, where the amount of work that is completed within the fixed time can change. All in all, boundaries are established by starting with the inception of a raw idea, then establishing the appetite and narrowing the problem scope down.

## Chapter 4 Summary
- You need the right people and the right level of detail. Two key techniques for this phase are breadboarding and fat marker sketches. Fat marker sketches are used for visual ideas, keeping the focus on the arrangement of elements. You should go in to too much details and give some bandwidth to desginers so they can have something to work on or improve in the design. It's important to note that at this stage, no commitments or promises have been made, and the project can still be abandoned if necessary.

## Chapter 5 Summary
- Risk of rabbit holes, these are unknows which can end up burning up lots of the allocated time for the shaping period. this is not good because it will delay the delivery and slow the team down. To combat this we need to discuss with more experienced people from the technical team, and figure out what could be a possible risk of being a rabbit hole. We should also should not be afraid to cut back extra work which can be labeled as nice to haves we want to have a shaped idea in a clear and communicative manner for wider evaluation and resource allocation, and over all we want to minimize the risk of the project we are going to take on.
